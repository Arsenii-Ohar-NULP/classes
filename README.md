### Logic
To built an app that has following educational functionality:
- there are two types of users: student and teacher
- student can send a join request to join a class
- teacher can accept or decline a join request
- class has a following information:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Teacher of this class
- to learn more go to a backend [github repo](https://github.com/SeeenyaOhar/labs-applied)
### Goal
To make a cool-looking frontend to interact with [the backend API](https://github.com/SeeenyaOhar/labs-applied) mentioned above.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/Arsenii-Ohar-NULP/Arsenii-Ohar-NULP.github.io.git

2. Install all the dependencies of the project.
```

```
3. Run the backend service for **port 2000**.
